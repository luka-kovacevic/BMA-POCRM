# MRC-BSU-Internship
The aim of this work is to develop an extension to the Partial Ordering Continual Reassessment Method (POCRM) proposed by Wages et al. (2011) to take into account further uncertainty in the ordering of doses in settings where this uncertainty is present. This work was completed at the MRC Biostatistics Unit between June 2021 and September 2021.
